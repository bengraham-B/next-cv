(1) I was unable to put my header component in the Layout folder.
(2) The pages of the application, about.js, contact.js and project.js have componets in them which comes from their repsective componet folder.
(3) In the componets folder the Header and Title folder will be used on each page and the Layout component will be the home page("/") of the 
    application.
(4) The application is styled using styled-jsx.
(5) The static image in the ProjectOne.js component, comes from the public folder as i was unable to server the image from the static folder.
